  -  How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?             
     When looking at user needs I tend to look at them objectively. For instance when a customer wants a different presentation style, that means I need to change the manner of projection, along with the size of text and style of movement. These details can be specified in a user story for someone to easily look at and move forward with.
    
  -  How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?                         
    I approach developing with a bit of a bull rush. I find it easier to go in trying and refine as you move closer to your objective. That being said I would love to incorporate something like the daily scrum into my group work and breaking up some assignments into little user stories to help me visualize the individual issues more.
    
  -  What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?         
    A good team member is someone who is willing to work with his/her team openly and incorporate everyones talents into the project. You can't take criticism personally, and you have to welcome the idea that your team may know more on a matter than you do. Communicating is the biggest factor thoe when it comes to the overall effectiveness of a team member. If they can't communicate then you can run into all sorts of issues.
